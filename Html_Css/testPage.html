                üòç Zero config ‚Äì Parcel supports many languages and file types out of the box, from web technologies like<br/> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to assets like images, fonts, videos, and more. It has a built-in dev server with<br/> hot reloading, beautiful error diagnostics, and much more. No configuration needed!<br/><br/>

                ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightning fast ‚Äì Parcel's JavaScript compiler is written in Rust for native performance. Your code is built <br/>  in parallel using worker threads, utilizing all of the cores on your machine. Everything is cached, so you<br/>  never build the same code twice. It's like using watch mode, but even when you restart Parcel!<br/> <br/> 
                </span>
                üöÄ Automatic production optimization ‚Äì Parcel optimizes your whole app for production automatically.<br/>  This includes tree-shaking and minifying your JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, resizing and optimizing images,<br/>  content hashing, automatic code splitting, and much more.<br/> <br/> 
                üéØ Ship for any target ‚Äì Parcel automatically transforms your code for your target environments. From<br/>  modern and legacy browser support, to zero config JSX and TypeScript compilation, Parcel makes it easy to<br/>  build for any target ‚Äì or many!<br/> <br/> 
                üåç Scalable ‚Äì Parcel requires zero configuration to get started. But as your<br/>  application grows and your build requirements become more complex, it's possible to extend Parcel in just about every way. A simple<br/>  configuration format and powerful plugin system that's designed from the ground up for performance <br/> means Parcel can support projects of any size.
